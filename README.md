# Early Diagnosis Model for Lung and Colon Cancer

This project is an Early Diagnosis Model for Lung and Colon Cancer, built using a dataset of 25,000 histopathological images of lung and colon cancer across 5 classes. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is named "Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images".

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an early diagnosis model for lung and colon cancer using deep learning techniques. The system is trained to identify and classify histopathological images of lung and colon cancer into different categories, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis of these cancers. Early diagnosis can significantly improve treatment outcomes and patient survival rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of:
1. **Histopathological Images**: A collection of 25,000 images categorized into 5 different classes of lung and colon cancer. The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is named **Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images**.

## Model
The AI model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to process the histopathological images and classify them into the appropriate cancer categories. The model's architecture includes multiple convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers to extract features from the images and make predictions. The model is trained using labeled data to achieve high accuracy in real-world medical diagnostic scenarios.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/early-diagnosis-model.git
    ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the main script to start the model training or prediction:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
